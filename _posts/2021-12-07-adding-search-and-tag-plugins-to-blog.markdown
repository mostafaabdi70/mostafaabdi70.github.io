üëãÔ∏è I'm so passionate to develop my blog by myself. I don't know ruby but I know ruby and python are so similar in terms of language syntax. Also working with markdowns, ruby modules and some new subjects to develop the blog makes me delighted. Especially those one what I didn't experience with them and I customize them for my blog. I'll share a post to say how I customized tagging functionality for my blog, if possible. The next step is probably to change the theme of the blog.
