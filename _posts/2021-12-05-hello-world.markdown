Hi folk,

After years disconnecting from the blogging world, last night I decided write again and run my new blog -not in `wordpress` but in `octopress`- so thanks to `octopress` I ran the blog in a few minutes!

This is my first blog after about three years which I had a wordpress blog and was discontinued. 
Generally, I'm not talkactive, thus I don't express so much in my posts and I'd like to represent the technical discussions in code, diagrams or logs with a brief explanations. The understanding and harvest the result needs your analysis about that subject.

If you want to getting know more about blog or me, you can read the [About Page][About-Page].
